<p>At the beginning of this year there was a new area opened on the second floor of the Futurama F building in Prague. The Innovation Lab is an office space unlike any other and there is huge difference compared to the rest of the Prague office. A modern hipster-like room, which enables creativity and working in different styles.</p>

<p>It would be shame to use such a room as simply a workspace.</p>

<p>Stanislav Siska and I had a chat and we both have an idea to create something more interesting than a nice and cozy office.</p>

<p>But how to start it? We did not want to reinvent the wheel and we have searched for inspiration.
We decided to visit some co-working spaces within Prague.</p>

<p>Co-working is a style of work that involves a shared workplace, often an office, and independent activity. Unlike in a typical office, those co-working together are not usually employed by the same organisation. Typically, it is attractive to work-at-home professionals, independent contractors, independent scientists or people who travel frequently who end up working in relative isolation.</p>

<p>Co-working has become pretty popular recently and each bigger city in the Czech Republic is offering such spaces. Prague, as the biggest city is offering the biggest choice. Some of them are partly a caf√© with space to work, some others offer a kindergarten.
You can find a list at <a href="https://navolnenoze.cz/blog/coworkingy/">https://navolnenoze.cz/blog/coworkingy/</a>
</p>

<p>We decided to visit one of the oldest co-working spaces in the Czech Republic - the Impact Hub in Smichov.</p>

<p>The place surprised us with its creativity and the amount of clever ideas that they have. An example is a self-service bar, where you can make coffee, tea or you take something to eat from the fridge. After you have served yourself, you put money into a cash box or you can pay using a hub card (if you are a regular).</p>

<p>The hub offers number of events each week, which vary in content. Some are dedicated to freelancers, others are general interest events. A short example: Brand building, IMPACT HUB LUNCH, Using a Mac effectively,

<ul>

<li><a href="https://www.hubpraha.cz/kalendar/">https://www.hubpraha.cz/kalendar/</a> </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>It's definitely been a great inspiration for us. We have scheduled a visit next week with the Hub community manager and we plan to gain as much experience from it as we can. Then we can try to use it in the Innovation Lab.
If you would like to join, it will take place on Monday 19.3. In the morning.
