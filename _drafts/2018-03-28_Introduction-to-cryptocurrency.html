CRYPTOCURRENCY â€“ THE PHENOMEN WE ENJOY !!!
With some exceptions, market is still not able to accept the cryptocurrency as commonly used currency. There is quite negative media image about Cryptocurrency. You might heard that this is only available for IT experts or it is actually not real money and you can buy drugs with this currency. On the top of this, it is dangerous and it should be forbidden and maybe something more.
 Cryptocurrency is a digital cash which is decentralized and anonymous. There is no government, institution or person who manage it or manipulate with rules. You have the control what you own.
We do shopping in China, we are watching American TV channels etc.  but using different currencies. Bitcoin is the first global cryptocurrency. It does not have any correlation with local economies.
There are two main parts which are investment and trading. There is a success in investment part which most people enjoy . You can earn with mining-you need to provide some calculating power to the system and 2nd option is trading. People are mixing those two things. With mining you want to stay with stable solution, prices where you can estimate what you earn. With trading, you accept volatility of crypto currency and you can enjoy it and earn.
What is good about cryptocurrency ?
It is very volatile, it is new, quick, cheaper and more reliable than money issued by government. It can be treated without leverage and you can always bet on something. One of the main reasons why this is attractive for traders who start with trading is a big growth within days. If you know the market you can earn a lot.
What is not good about cryptocurrency?
Since cryptocurrency are relatively new, it is difficult to understand and people are not aware of how to use it. You can lose your wallet, therefore it is better to remember your password and not lose the device. In case you mistakenly pay someone by using cryptocurrency, there is no way to reverse your payment-you can only ask the person for refund. Cryptocurrency is not regulated
Where to start?
Start with something small, usually 100 USD, use public Exchanges (most common ones are BitFinex, HitBTC, Kraken etc.). There are technical differences, different set of instruments but they all behaved pretty much the same. It is good to read blogs, watch tutorials, listen podcast to achieve what is market about and read newspaper to be up to date.
If you do not have fun with cryptocurrency you can not profit.
